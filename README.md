## About 
Hi! This is Zypro Keyboard Layout for macOS made with [Ukelele App](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele)

This layout is designed specifically for programmers who are used to working with the top row, as well as with various characters such as brackets and punctuation marks using QWERTY keyboard, but who also needs the German QWERTZ layout letters.

That's what Zypro layout looks like:

## Installation
* Move the keyboard layout to `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`
(keyboard layouts in ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/ can't be selected in password dialogs or on the login window)  
* Restart the computer. Logging out and back in is not enough.
* Enable the new keyboard layout from System Preferences.  
To apply changes to a keyboard layout, run sudo touch /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/ and restart.

Feel free to use this layout and be happy with your US-German keyboard üëç
